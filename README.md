# Maria Spanou — Computer Science & Engineering Student

## About Me

Hello! I’m Maria Spanou, a Computer Science and Engineering student at the University of Ioannina with a strong interest in **digital hardware systems**, **testability**, and **high-reliability computing**. I enjoy working in areas where hardware, software, and algorithms intersect — particularly in low-level system design, verification, and intelligent systems.

My academic projects reflect both sides of my engineering profile:  
on one hand, **VHDL-based hardware implementations** (JTAG, BIST, scan chains, LFSRs, MISRs, TAP controllers) and on the other, **software and AI projects** (machine learning, search algorithms, simulation tools, and game-based environments).  
I am especially motivated by systems that require **precision, dependability, and rigorous testing**, and I aspire to work in research-oriented environments that combine hardware and computation — such as large-scale scientific infrastructures or high-performance computing labs.

## Projects

### Digital Hardware & Dependability (VHDL)
My strongest engineering work focuses on digital testing and verification:

- **Scan-Chain TRCUT Implementation** – Serial scan structure enabling controllability, observability, and full scan-based testing.  
- **BIST with LFSR & MISR** – Pseudorandom test generation, response compression, and signature verification.  
- **JTAG TAP Controller** – Fully implemented IEEE 1149.1 boundary-scan architecture with TAP FSM and instruction decoding.  

Through these projects, I gained experience in:
- RTL design (VHDL)  
- DFT (Design for Testability)  
- scan flip-flops, pattern shifting & capture  
- pseudorandom pattern generation  
- signature analysis & fault detection  
- simulation workflows in ModelSim  
- RTL / Technology Map verification in Quartus

### Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
- **MLP & K-Means (Java)** – Implemented core ML algorithms from scratch.  
- **AI Search Algorithms** – UCS, A*, Minimax applied to puzzle-solving and strategic decision-making.  
- **ML Workflows in Python** – Data handling, small experimental pipelines, and algorithmic exploration.

I enjoy understanding how algorithms behave internally — not only using libraries, but reasoning through the underlying computation.

### Software Engineering & Applications
- **Treegram Social App (Ruby)** – Web application prototype.  
- **Unity 3D Maze Game (C#)** – Interactive 3D puzzle game.  
- **Peg Solitaire, Guess-the-Word, Stones Game (Python)**  
- **Data Structures & Algorithms (Java)**  
- **Robotics Simulation with ROS (Python)**  

These projects strengthened my foundations in problem-solving, system design, and software structuring.
